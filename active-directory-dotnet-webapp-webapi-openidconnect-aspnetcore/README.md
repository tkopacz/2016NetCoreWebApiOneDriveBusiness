# Calling a web API in an ASP.NET Core web application using Azure AD
This sample shows how to build an MVC web application that uses Azure AD for sign-in using the OpenID Connect protocol, and then calls a web API under the signed-in user's identity using tokens obtained via OAuth 2.0. This sample uses the OpenID Connect ASP.Net middleware and ADAL .Net running on ASP.NET Core.

For more information about how the protocols work in this scenario and other scenarios, see [Authentication Scenarios for Azure AD](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=394414).

> This sample has finally been updated to ASP.NET Core 1.0.  Looking for previous versions of this code sample? Check out the tags on the [releases](../../releases) GitHub page.

## How To Run This Sample

Getting started is simple!  To run this sample you will need:
- Install .NET Core for Windows by following the instructions at [dot.net/core](https://dot.net/core), which will include Visual Studio 2015 Update 3.
- An Internet connection
- An Azure subscription (a free trial is sufficient)

Every Azure subscription has an associated Azure Active Directory tenant.  If you don't already have an Azure subscription, you can get a free subscription by signing up at [https://azure.microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com).  All of the Azure AD features used by this sample are available free of charge.

### Step 1:  Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

`git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-webapp-webapi-openidconnect-aspnetcore.git`

### Step 2:  Create a user account in your Azure Active Directory tenant

If you already have a user account in your Azure Active Directory tenant, you can skip to the next step.  This sample will not work with a Microsoft account, so if you signed in to the Azure portal with a Microsoft account and have never created a user account in your directory before, you need to do that now.  If you create an account and want to use it to sign-in to the Azure portal, don't forget to add the user account as a co-administrator of your Azure subscription.

### Step 3:  Register the sample with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There are two projects in this sample.  Each needs to be separately registered in your Azure AD tenant.

#### Register the TodoListService web API

1. Sign in to the [Azure management portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com).
2. Click on Active Directory in the left hand nav.
3. Click the directory tenant where you wish to register the sample application.
4. Click the Applications tab.
5. In the drawer, click Add.
6. Click "Add an application my organization is developing".
7. Enter a friendly name for the application, for example "TodoListService", select "Web Application and/or Web API", and click next.
8. For the sign-on URL, enter the base URL for the sample, which is by default `https://localhost:44351`.
9. For the App ID URI, enter `https://<your_tenant_name>/TodoListService`, replacing `<your_tenant_name>` with the name of your Azure AD tenant.  Click OK to complete the registration.
10. While still in the Azure portal, click the Configure tab of your application.
11. Find the Client ID value and copy it aside, you will need this later when configuring your application.

#### Register the TodoListWebApp web application

1. Sign in to the [Azure management portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com).
2. Click on Active Directory in the left hand nav.
3. Click the directory tenant where you wish to register the sample application.
4. Click the Applications tab.
5. In the drawer, click Add.
6. Click "Add an application my organization is developing".
7. Enter a friendly name for the application, for example "TodoListWebApp", select "Web Application and/or Web API", and click next.
8. For the sign-on URL, enter the base URL for the sample, which is by default `https://localhost:44371/signin-oidc`.
9. For the App ID URI, enter `https://<your_tenant_name>/TodoListWebApp`, replacing `<your_tenant_name>` with the name of your Azure AD tenant.  Click OK to complete the registration.
1. While still in the Azure portal, click the **Configure** tab of your application.
2. Locate the **Manage Manifest** button in the bottom drawer.  Click it and download your application's manifest as a `.json` file.
3. Open the `.json` file in a text editor and change the `logoutUrl` property to `https://localhost:44371/Account/EndSession`.  This is the default single sign out URL for this sample.
4. Back in the Azure portal, click **Manage Manifest** then **Upload Manifest**, and upload your updated `.json` file.
5. Finally, locate the **Client ID** value in the **Configure** tab and copy it to your clipboard.  You will need it shortly.
12. Create a new key for the application.  Save the configuration so you can view the key value.  Save this aside for when you configure the project in Visual Studio.
13. In "Permissions to Other Applications", click "Add Application."  Select "Other" in the "Show" dropdown, and click the upper check mark.  Locate & click on the TodoListService, and click the bottom check mark to add the application.  Select "Access TodoListService" from the "Delegated Permissions" dropdown, and save the configuration.

### Step 4:  Configure the sample to use your Azure AD tenant

#### Configure the TodoListService project

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio 2015.
2. Open the `appsettings.json` file.
3. Find the `Tenant` property and replace the value with your AAD tenant name, e.g. contoso.onmicrosoft.com.
4. Find the `Audience` property and replace the value with the App ID URI you registered earlier, for example `https://<your_tenant_name>/TodoListService`.

#### Configure the TodoListWebApp project

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio 2015.
2. Open the `appsettings.json` file.
3. Find the `Tenant` property and replace the value with your AAD tenant name, e.g. contoso.onmicrosoft.com.
4. Find the `ClientId` property and replace the value with the Client ID for the TodoListWebApp from the Azure portal.
5. Find the `ClientSecret` and replace the value with the key for the TodoListWebApp from the Azure portal.
6. If you changed the base URL of the TodoListWebApp sample, find the `PostLogoutRedirectUri` property and replace the value with the new base URL of the sample.
8. Find the `TodoListResourceId` property and replace the value with the App ID URI registered for the TodoListService, for example `https://<your_tenant_name>/TodoListService`.

### Step 5:  Trust the IIS Express SSL certificate

Since the web API is SSL protected, the client of the API (the web app) will refuse the SSL connection to the web API unless it trusts the API's SSL certificate.  Use the following steps in Windows Powershell to trust the IIS Express SSL certificate.  You only need to do this once.  If you fail to do this step, calls to the TodoListService will always throw an unhandled exception where the inner exception message is:

"The underlying connection was closed: Could not establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel."

To configure your computer to trust the IIS Express SSL certificate, begin by opening a Windows Powershell command window as Administrator.

Query your personal certificate store to find the thumbprint of the certificate for `CN=localhost`:

```
PS C:\windows\system32> dir Cert:\LocalMachine\My


    Directory: Microsoft.PowerShell.Security\Certificate::LocalMachine\My


Thumbprint                                Subject
----------                                -------
C24798908DA71693C1053F42A462327543B38042  CN=localhost
```

Next, add the certificate to the Trusted Root store:

```
PS C:\windows\system32> $cert = (get-item cert:\LocalMachine\My\C24798908DA71693C1053F42A462327543B38042)
PS C:\windows\system32> $store = (get-item cert:\Localmachine\Root)
PS C:\windows\system32> $store.Open("ReadWrite")
PS C:\windows\system32> $store.Add($cert)
PS C:\windows\system32> $store.Close()
```

You can verify the certificate is in the Trusted Root store by running this command:

`PS C:\windows\system32> dir Cert:\LocalMachine\Root`

### Step 6:  Run the sample

Clean the solution, rebuild the solution, and run it.  You might want to go into the solution properties and set both projects as startup projects, with the service project starting first.

Explore the sample by signing in, To Do List link, adding items to the To Do list, signing out, and starting again.
